# PyScript and FastAPI

How will pyscript fare as an in-browser language? That is the question.
Also, it's about time I try out FastAPI.

**Results**

* it's pretty slow so far
* the drop-in REPL is failing because of a CORS error at the moment. Maybe it'll work but if it doesn't it's not my fault.
* I can't make HTTP requests. At least with the requests library. Makes it hard to have a client-server application.
* Included code has to be available as plaintext so inherits all the issues that come with that
